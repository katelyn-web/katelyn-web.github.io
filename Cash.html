    <p> A cash bank deposit is the simplest, most easily understandable investment assetâ€”and the safest. Not only does it give investors precise knowledge of the interest they'll earn, but it also guarantees they'll get their capital back. </p>
    <p> On the downside, the interest earned from cash socked away in a savings account seldom beats inflation. Certificates of deposit (CDs) are highly liquid instruments, very similar to cash that are instruments that typically provide higher interest rates than those in savings accounts. However, money is locked up for a period of time and there are potential early withdrawal penalties involved. </p>
